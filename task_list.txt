1. Hybrid3D Approach implementation
2. Convert from point cloud to voxel grids
3. Use 3 ray tracers at precise voxel locations
4. Optimize further with Ricci Flow if necessary
5. If we want, convert current voxel grids back to mesh via MarchingCubes
6. Use coconut (chain of continous thought) reasoning for multimodal model implementation and using techniques found in those research papers
7. Animations
8. Optional: Include token-free implementation
9. Preprint Research Paper
10. Apply to IEEE (gotta find specific journal in IEEE)
11. Pray and Win

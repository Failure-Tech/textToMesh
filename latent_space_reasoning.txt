Token-Free 3D Generation with Coconut-Style Reasoning
Modify 3DiM's pipeline to use continuous latent coordinates instead of fixed camera matrices. 
Implement differentiable ray marching through latent space coordinates using positional encoding.

Training Protocol

Phase 1: Train with full viewpoint tokens

Phase 2: Replace 50% of tokens with learned latent embeddings

Phase 3: Complete token elimination (use [BOCT]/[EOCT] markers from Coconut)

Traning Objectives:
- Holographic reconstruction (Fresnel transformation)
- Latent space regularization
- Compression rate

Recommended Pipeline:

Start with 2D view synthesis using modified Coconut reasoning

Gradually extend to 3D via differentiable volume rendering

Add compression components incrementally

Final joint training with all losses

1. Baseline 2D View Synthesis
    - impl encoder for input image tokens
    - add transformer decoder to condition on viewpoint tokens
    - reproduce standard 3DiM-like view synthesis

2. Latent View Embedding Module
    - replace fixed camera/viewpoint tokens with learned latent coords
    - apply positional encoding to viewpoint coords
    - small MLP

3. BOCT/EOCT Framing (Coconut-Style)
    - Special markers: [IMG_Tokens] + [BOCT] + z_view + [EOCT]
    - Eliminate view tokens

4. Differentiable Volume Rendering
    - NeRF-Style Ray marching
    - Fresnel propagatino for Holographic rendering
    - FFT --> Phase Mask --> iFFT

5. Compression + Autoencoding
    - Image token compressor
    - Replace high-dim image features w/ compressed ones

6. Join Training
    - Combine all components


1. Hybrid3D Approach implementation
2. Convert from point cloud to voxel grids
3. Use 3 ray tracers at precise voxel locations
4. Optimize further with Ricci Flow if necessary
5. If we want, convert current voxel grids back to mesh via MarchingCubes
6. Use coconut (chain of continous thought) reasoning for multimodal model implementation and using techniques found in those research papers
7. Animations
8. Optional: Include token-free implementation
9. Preprint Research Paper
10. Apply to IEEE (gotta find specific journal in IEEE)
11. Pray and Win

hybrid3D approach --> convert from point cloud system to voxel locations --> 3 raytracers for precise voxel locations --> optimization via Ricci flow if we feel like it --> output --> chain of continuous thought model implementation (coconut style bs) --> animations (figure out how to do this, maybe stringing together model movements? needs more research)
